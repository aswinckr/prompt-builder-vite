# Product Mission

## Pitch
Prompt Builder is a context management tool that helps AI power users eliminate friction in prompt construction by providing a modular system to quickly select and combine reusable knowledge blocks, turning 5-minute context assembly into a 10-second workflow.

## Users

### Primary Customers
- **Creative Power Users**: Product Managers, Designers, Entrepreneurs, and Researchers who use AI tools 10-20 times daily and need to frequently provide context to AI assistants
- **Corporate Team Members**: Team Leads and Knowledge Managers who collaborate with AI tools and need standardized context sharing within teams

### User Personas

**Creative Power User** (25-45 years)
- **Role:** Product Manager, Designer, Entrepreneur, or Researcher
- **Context:** Heavy AI user working on multiple projects simultaneously, frequently switching contexts between different AI interactions
- **Pain Points:**
  - Wastes 4-5 minutes per prompt manually assembling context from previous conversations, documents, and research
  - Loses flow state and reduces AI interaction frequency by 60% due to context assembly friction
  - Struggles to maintain consistent context across different AI platforms and sessions
- **Goals:**
  - Reduce prompt preparation time from minutes to seconds
  - Maintain consistent, high-quality context across AI interactions
  - Increase AI usage frequency and effectiveness through faster workflows

**Corporate Team Member** (28-50 years)
- **Role:** Team Lead, Knowledge Manager, or Senior Developer
- **Context:** Working in collaborative environments where teams need consistent context for AI-powered workflows
- **Pain Points:**
  - Team members waste time recreating similar context blocks independently
  - Lack of standardized context templates across the organization
  - Difficulty sharing and maintaining context knowledge within teams
- **Goals:**
  - Establish shared context repositories for team efficiency
  - Enable rapid context assembly for team AI workflows
  - Reduce redundant context creation across team members

## The Problem

### Context Assembly Friction
AI power users waste significant time manually assembling context for each prompt, costing 4-5 minutes per interaction and reducing AI usage frequency by 60%. This friction creates a barrier to effective AI collaboration and limits the potential of AI-powered workflows.

**Our Solution:** Transform context into modular, reusable blocks accessible via a global command palette, enabling rapid assembly of high-quality prompts in seconds rather than minutes. By making context as easy to assemble as LEGO blocks, we eliminate the friction that prevents users from leveraging AI to its full potential.

## Differentiators

### Lightning-Fast Global Access
Unlike traditional note-taking apps or browser extensions that require multiple clicks and navigation, Prompt Builder provides instant global access via ⌘+Shift+P command palette, reducing context assembly time from minutes to seconds.

### Purpose-Built for AI Workflows
Unlike generic clipboard managers or note apps, Prompt Builder is specifically designed for AI context management with smart features like context templates, AI-optimized formatting, and seamless integration with popular AI platforms.

### Modular Context Architecture
Unlike simple text snippets, Prompt Builder's context blocks are intelligent, searchable, and combinable components that understand relationships between different pieces of knowledge, enabling sophisticated context assembly that adapts to specific AI tasks.
