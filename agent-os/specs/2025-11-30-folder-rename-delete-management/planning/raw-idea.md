# Folder Management Feature - Raw Idea

The user wants to add functionality to delete or rename folders within their application. Specifically:

1. When hovering on a folder (inside prompts or datasets sections), an overflow icon should appear on the right side
2. The overflow icon should be always visible on mobile devices
3. Clicking the overflow icon presents a dropdown menu (using shadcn UI) with options to rename or delete folders
4. Selecting these options opens a modal dialog to perform the corresponding action
