# Extend + Add Context Button with Dropdown Options

## Feature Description

User wants to extend the "+ Add context" button in the /prompt page with enhanced functionality.

### Current Behavior
- Clicking "+ Add context" button jumps directly to /knowledge page

### Expected Behavior
- Clicking "+ Add context" button shows a dropdown with two options:
  1. "Add Text Block" - adds a tiptap formattable box directly in the context list below the button
  2. "Add Knowledge" - navigates to the knowledge tab (current behavior)

### Purpose
This is a UX enhancement to provide users with more direct options for adding context to their prompts, allowing them to either add quick text blocks directly or browse their knowledge library.
