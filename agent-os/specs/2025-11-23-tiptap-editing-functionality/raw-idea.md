# Raw Idea: Tiptap-based Editing Functionality

Add tiptap-based editing functionality to SavedPrompts and ContextBlocks. The feature should:

1. Make all SavedPrompts and ContextBlocks editable using tiptap
2. Open a modal (responsive on mobile view) for editing
3. Allow content formatting and editing capabilities
4. Save changes locally (persist across refreshes for now)
5. Database syncing will be implemented later

This is for a prompt builder application.
